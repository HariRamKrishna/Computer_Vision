The motivation of this project is the task that I was assigned to find good photos for flex. A lot of images were already categorized as suitable for flex.
However, It was unfortunate to know later that the image were of low resolution, particulary due to quality compromise after second party social media transfer.
So, the aim of this project is to extract high resolution image from pool of about 1000 images, given the low resolution version of few good images.
